## Abstract

Dashboard cameras support continuous recording of external views providing evidence of unexpected traffic-related accidents and incidents. Recently, the sharing of dashcam videos gained significant traction for accident investigation and entertainment purposes. Dashboard cameras are inexpensive, but they also have many limitations. Unfortunately, many of these devices, especially lower-end models, have inadequate recording capabilities and do not use cloud storage. In contrast, the higher-end models are expensive and require an operator to install a camera. 

Although dashboard cameras can detect other vehicles, they can also identify road conditions. Unfortunately, this functionality is costly and only available in high-end cameras. Most dashboard cameras also lack the processing power to perform image or video analysis. Given the benefits and limitations of dashboard cameras, our solution will use mobile devices to capture videos and use cloud services such as Google Drive and Firebase to store the recordings. These videos can then be enhanced via digital image processing functions with OpenCV/YoloV5 and shared via cloud storage solutions.
